# NHL Game Tracker

This project is a client rendering application built with [React.js](https://reactjs.org) and the [NHL API](https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi/tree/master)!

### Features:
 - View all of todays matchups on the main landing page
 - View start time, venue and rosters of each team in preview mode
 - During live games get all scoring details as well as list of players currently on the ice
 - View final score, and scoring as soon as a match is over

I am using this project to learn React, so my focus is on building components and creating an optimal flow of data throughout the application. Becuase of this, styling has taken somewhat of a backseat. For most styling elements I have used the [Materialize.css](https://materializecss.com) framework so that I can focus on learning React.

UPDATE (17-Mar-2020): As the season has been postponed, so has my development on this project as I am unable to simulate live data using the API.

This application is open source though the [MIT License](https://github.com/Cory44/NHL-Game-Tracker/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)
